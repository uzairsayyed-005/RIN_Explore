# Understanding the RIN Knowledge Graph Project

### Why This Exploration?

By working through these tasks, I aim to:

- Familiarize myself with the scope of the project and keep track of its resources and details.
- Lay a **strong foundation** to better understand the project.

| **Dates**     | **Task Heading**                                                      | **Status**    |
