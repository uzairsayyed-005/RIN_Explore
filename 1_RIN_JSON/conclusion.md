## Conclusion

The **JSON data** is inherently **hierarchical**, with clearly defined **top-level entities** (like `authority`, `item`, and `distributions`) and **nested relationships** (such as `related` and `abbreviations`) that serve as natural nodes and edges. This structure not only simplifies the mapping process to a graph format but also provides a modular and scalable foundation for data representation.

The advantage of a hierarchical structure lies in its ability to clearly separate different data categories while still capturing complex relationships. This makes it easier to maintain, update, and extend the dataset, ensuring that the resulting knowledge graph is both **efficient** and **insightful**. Overall, the organized and modular nature of the JSON data is key to building a robust and scalable knowledge graph for our project.
