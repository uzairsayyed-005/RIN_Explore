# LinkML Exploration Folder

This folder contains various resources and code examples that I explored to get familiarized with LinkML. I executed several code snippets and experimented with different aspects of schema design and data modeling using LinkML.

I referred to the official [LinkML Documentation](https://linkml.io/) throughout this process, which provided valuable guidance and insights into creating and managing structured data effectively.
