# Project Overview

This folder contains two key components: First, a sample LinkML schema was created and an example entry was validated against it. This step confirms that the schema correctly defines the data structure, types, and constraints, ensuring that individual entries adhere to the required standards.

Second, a container was added to the schema to group multiple entries together. This container facilitates managing collections of objects defined by the schema, streamlining the handling, processing, and organization of batch data.
