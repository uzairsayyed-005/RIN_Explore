# Schema Concepts Overview

**Enums:**  
Enumerations (Enums) in LinkML define controlled vocabularies that restrict an attribute's values to a predefined set. This ensures data consistency, reduces errors by standardizing input, and, when mapped to ontology terms, enriches semantic interoperability.

**Inheritance:**  
Inheritance in LinkML allows you to create a base class with common attributes and then extend it in specialized subclasses. This promotes reusability and clear schema organization by enabling child classes to automatically include attributes from their parent class.
